Metals such as potassium and sodium react so\\nvigorously that they catch fire if kept in the open. Hence, to protect them\\nand to prevent accidental fires, they are kept immersed in kerosene oil.\\nAt ordinary temperature, the surfaces of metals such as magnesium,\\naluminium, zinc, lead, etc., are covered with a thin layer of oxide. Theprotective oxide layer prevents the metal from further oxidation. Iron\\ndoes not burn on heating but iron filings burn vigorously when sprinkled\\nin the flame of the burner. Copper does not burn, but the hot metal is\\ncoated with a black coloured layer of copper(II) oxide. Silver and gold do\\nnot react with oxygen even at high temperatures.Do You Know?Anodising is a process of forming a thick oxide layer of aluminium. Aluminium\\ndevelops a thin oxide layer when exposed to air. This aluminium oxide coat makes itresistant to further corrosion.  The resistance can be improved further by making the\\noxide layer thicker.  During anodising, a clean aluminium article is made the anode\\nand is electrolysed with dilute sulphuric acid. The oxygen gas evolved at the anodereacts with aluminium to make a thicker protective oxide layer.  This oxide layer can\\nbe dyed easily to give aluminium articles an attractive finish.\\nAfter performing Activity 3.9, you must have observed that sodium\\nis the most reactive of the samples of metals taken here. The reaction of\\nmagnesium is less vigorous implying that it is not as reactive as sodium.But burning in oxygen does not help us to decide about the reactivity of\\nzinc, iron, copper or lead.

This is because a considerable\\namount of energy is required to break the strong inter-ionic\\nattraction.\\n(iii) Solubility : Electrovalent compounds are generally soluble in\\nwater and insoluble in solvents such as kerosene, petrol, etc.\\n(iv)Conduction of Electricity : The conduction of electricity through\\na solution involves the movement of charged particles. A solutionof an ionic compound in water contains ions, which move to the\\nopposite electrodes when electricity is passed through the\\nsolution. Ionic compounds in the solid state do not conductelectricity because movement of ions in the solid is not possible\\ndue to their rigid structure. But ionic compounds conduct\\nelectricity in the molten state. This is possible in the molten statesince the elecrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositelycharged ions are overcome due to the heat.

The metals in the middle of the activity series\\n(Zn, Fe, Pb, etc.) are moderately reactive. They are found in the earth’s\\ncrust mainly as oxides, sulphides or carbonates. You will find thatthe ores of many metals are oxides. This is because oxygen is a veryreactive element and is very abundant on the earth.\\nThus on the basis of reactivity, we can group the metals into the\\nfollowing three categories (Fig. 3.9) – (i) Metals of low reactivity; (ii) Metals\\nof medium reactivity; (iii) Metals of high reactivity.

The oxides of these\\nmetals can be  reduced to metals by heating alone. For example, cinnabar\\n(HgS) is an ore of mercury.

These are usually present as\\nsulphides or carbonates in nature. It is easier to obtain a metal from its\\noxide, as compared to its sulphides and carbonates. Therefore, prior toreduction, the metal sulphides and carbonates must be converted into\\nmetal oxides. The sulphide ores are converted into oxides by heating\\nstrongly in the presence of excess air. This process is known as roasting.\\nThe carbonate ores are changed into oxides by heating strongly in limited\\nair. This process is known as calcina tion.
